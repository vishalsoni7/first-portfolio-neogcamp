                    <h1>I am a street Dog 🐾</h1>
                    <p>In this guest post, ‘I am a stray dog’, Amrita Paul questions the indifference the so-called
                        ‘pet-owners’ have towards the homeless dogs. Is the pedigree that necessary for our friend; to
                        have not the privilege of a pet, but at least the equal rights to survive? Being a dog who has
                        seen the roads up, close and personal, I know enough to reason that not everyone who has a dog
                        is, a dog lover.</p>

                    <h1>Hachiko 🐕 </h1>
                    <p>Have you ever heard of Hachiko the dog? No? Neither had I until we visited Tokyo. If you ever go
                        to Japan then odds are you will hear about him.

                        Hachiko is a national hero to the Japanese! A dog so famous there have been several movies made
                        about him.

                        He has his own bronze statue next to Shibuya Train Station in Tokyo, where every day hundreds of
                        people have their photograph taken with him. </p>
