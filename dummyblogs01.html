                    <h1>this is a dummy blog</h1>
                    <p>Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the visual impression of
                        different typefaces Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web
                        designers to occupy the space which will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required
                        when, for example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'.
                        It is said that song composers of the past used dummy texts as lyrics when writing melodies in
                        order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by
                        typesetters since the 16th century.</p>

                    <h1>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h1>

                    <p>Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different typefaces and layouts, and in
                        general the content of dummy text is nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for
                        layouts, non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to recognize certain
                        patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution of letters and 'words' is random, the
                        reader will not be distracted from making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and
                        readability of the typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout or
                        type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or less random series of
                        words or syllables. This prevents repetitive patterns from impairing the overall visual
                        impression and facilitates the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is
                        advantageous when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout impression of the
                        final publication is not compromised.</p>

                    <h1>Incomprehensibility or readability? That is the question.</h1>

                    <p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th
                        century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to
                        'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also
                        incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin script. The
                        advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text
                        does not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.
